/// The strip of screen Apple's Dock reserves, and how to borrow it.
///
/// A window that zooms fills `NSScreen.visibleFrame`, and a borderless panel
/// does not shrink that by existing, at any window level. So a visible shelf
/// sits on top of zoomed windows and permanently covers their bottom edge,
/// which is issue #46 and the reason the shelf was only really usable
/// auto-hidden.
///
/// `-[NSScreen visibleFrame]` is `_layoutFrame` with exactly one rect taken
/// out of it: the global dock rect WindowServer hands out through
/// `SLSGetDockRectWithOrientation`. That rect is the only lever there is.
///
/// Writing it directly is possible and useless. `SLSSetDockRectWithReason`
/// returns success from an unentitled, ad-hoc signed process and really does
/// move `visibleFrame`, but only for processes launched afterwards: AppKit
/// caches the rect per process and refreshes it only from a broadcast over the
/// Dock's own MachService, which is SIP protected and which nothing else can
/// send. Apple's Dock then re-asserts its own rect within about a second and a
/// half. So the write lands, nothing that is already running notices, and the
/// Dock takes it back.
///
/// What works is to stop treating Apple's Dock as an obstacle. Leave it
/// running and visible on the shelf's own edge, sized so the strip it already
/// reserves is the strip the shelf wants, and draw the shelf over the top of
/// it. `visibleFrame` shrinks for free, and because the reservation belongs to
/// the Dock, every running app is told about it properly and immediately.
